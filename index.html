	<p> Hi, Im a PhD student working in the <a href="http://www.biglab.co.uk/people/"><em>Bristol Interaction Group</em></a>. I work on personal fabrication of displays. 
		I have a keen interest in 3D printing and am looking to expand what we are able to achieve by approaching display fabrication using spray painting. 
		This has led me to studying how spray painting can apply active materials to irregular surfaces and what kind of applications we can explore using
		spraying. Recently I have been working on combining 3D printing and spraying of electroluminescent paint in a usable manner to create 3D 
		displays with irregular shapes. Using purely additive manufacturing methods we are able to empower makers to produce 3D prints with
		interactive embedded displays.
		
		My background is in Maths, Computer Science and software development. I am contactable on
